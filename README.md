# STOCK MARKET PREDICTION

In this project I analized a numerapi stock market dataset, deleting some useless data and applying modifications. This is done with the purpose of training a Random Forest model, which at the end using 'feature importance from model' and 'feature time stability' I neutralized the 30% most important features that also are the 30% most instable during time. The pickle files are all the models I trained, the worst one is the 'model_standarized.pkl' and the best one is 'neutralization_model.pkl'.
